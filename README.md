# Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing to help developers write safer and more reliable code. However, since JavaScript is dynamically typed, TypeScript must also accommodate scenarios where types are unknown or ambiguous at compile-time.

In TypeScript, the static typing system can catch many issues at compile-time. However, some scenarios require additional runtime checks because TypeScript cannot always infer the specific type within a union of possible types. 

Type guards address this issue by providing a way to check and "narrow down" types. This ensures:

- Code Safety: You can confidently use specific properties or methods once you've confirmed a variableâ€™s type.

- Code Predictability: Type guards help prevent runtime errors, which can occur if you mistakenly try to perform operations or access properties on incompatible types.

- Readability: Type guards make it clear what type a variable is at each point in the code, which helps others understand the logic.
