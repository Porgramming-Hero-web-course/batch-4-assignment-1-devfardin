# Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing to help developers write safer and more reliable code. However, since JavaScript is dynamically typed, TypeScript must also accommodate scenarios where types are unknown or ambiguous at compile-time. Type guards in TypeScript help handle such scenarios by allowing developers to narrow down variable types during runtime, ensuring code executes safely and predictably.
